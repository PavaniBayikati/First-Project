# Gym Entry Management System

**Problem Statement:-**
Managing gym entries manually at GITAM has become
challenging, particularly in accurately tracking the count of
entries. The situation is exacerbated by the loss of a physical
book containing entry data from the past year. To address these
challenges, a solution is needed to automate the entry tracking
process and recover the lost data efficiently.
**Solution: -**
To address the challenge of manually tracking gym entries at
GITAM and the loss of entry records, we developed a solution
that involves storing entry data directly into a backend database
using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java Servlets and apache tomcat server. This enables
seamless data management and retrieval, ensuring the
preservation of entry records and facilitating easy access for
administrative purposes.
